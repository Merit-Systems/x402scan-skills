## Common Parameters

### Field Filtering (Cost Reduction)

Most endpoints support `excludeFields` to reduce response size:

```json
{
  "email": "user@company.com",
  "excludeFields": ["employment_history", "photos"]
}
```

### Bulk Operations

Apollo bulk endpoints accept arrays of up to 10 items:

```json
{
  "people": [
    { "email": "person1@company.com" },
    { "email": "person2@company.com" }
  ]
}
```

## Using the MCP Tools

All endpoints are called via `mcp__x402__fetch`:

```
mcp__x402__fetch(
  url="https://enrichx402.com/api/{endpoint}",
  method="POST",
  body={ ... }
)
```

The MCP handles wallet authentication and x402 payment automatically.

## Common Mistakes

**Never guess endpoint paths.** All endpoints require the correct provider prefix.

| Incorrect (guessed) | Correct | Error |
|---------------------|---------|-------|
| `/api/people/search` | `/api/apollo/people-search` | 405 |
| `/api/people-enrich` | `/api/apollo/people-enrich` | 405 |
| `/api/org/search` | `/api/apollo/org-search` | 405 |
| `/api/grok/search` | `/api/grok/x-search` | 405 |
| `/api/twitter/search` | `/api/grok/x-search` | 405 |
| `/api/linkedin/scrape` | `/api/clado/linkedin-scrape` | 405 |
| `/api/maps/search` | `/api/google-maps/text-search/partial` | 405 |

**Wrong parameter names will also fail:**

| Incorrect | Correct |
|-----------|---------|
| `{"name": "John Doe"}` | `{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe"}` |
| `{"company": "Acme"}` | `{"organization_name": "Acme"}` |
| `{"url": "..."}` | `{"linkedin_url": "..."}` |

**If unsure:**
1. Use `mcp__x402__discover_api_endpoints(url="https://enrichx402.com")` to list all endpoints
2. Use `mcp__x402__check_endpoint_schema(url="...")` to see expected parameters
3. Consult the skill documentation (SKILL.md files)
