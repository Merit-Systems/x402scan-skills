# Social Intelligence with x402 APIs

> **STOP — Read before making any API call.** enrichx402.com endpoints are **not** the same as each provider's native API. All paths use the format `https://enrichx402.com/api/{provider}/{action}`. You MUST either:
> 1. Copy exact URLs from the Quick Reference table below, OR
> 2. Run `x402.discover_api_endpoints(url="https://enrichx402.com")` to get the correct paths
>
> **Guessing paths will fail** with 405 errors (wrong path) or 404 errors (missing `/api/` prefix).

Access X/Twitter (via Grok) and Reddit through x402-protected endpoints.
