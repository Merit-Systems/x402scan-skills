# Privacy Considerations

## Responsible Use

Whitepages endpoints provide access to personal information from public records. Use responsibly:

### Legitimate Uses
- Verifying contact information for business purposes
- Reconnecting with lost contacts (family, old friends)
- Property research for real estate transactions
- Due diligence for business relationships
- Fraud prevention and verification

### Inappropriate Uses
- Stalking or harassment
- Unauthorized surveillance
- Bypassing someone's privacy preferences
- Building unauthorized marketing lists
- Any illegal purpose

## Data Sensitivity

The data returned may include:
- Home addresses (current and historical)
- Phone numbers
- Age information
- Family relationships
- Property ownership

This is sensitive personal information. Handle appropriately:
- Don't share results unnecessarily
- Don't store results beyond immediate need
- Don't use for purposes the person wouldn't expect
- Respect opt-out requests if contacted

## Legal Considerations

- Data comes from public records
- Use must comply with applicable laws
- FCRA applies to certain uses (employment, credit, tenant screening)
- State privacy laws may apply

**For regulated uses (employment screening, tenant checks, etc.):** Use a proper consumer reporting agency, not general people-search tools.

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize lookups** - Only search when necessary
2. **Be specific** - Provide enough detail to find the right person on first try
3. **Verify context** - Ensure you have a legitimate reason
4. **Protect results** - Don't expose personal data unnecessarily
5. **Consider alternatives** - LinkedIn, company websites, or direct contact may be better options

## When to Use Alternatives

| Need | Better Alternative |
|------|-------------------|
| Professional contact | LinkedIn, company website |
| Business info | Apollo org-enrich |
| Email verification | Clado contacts-enrich |
| General background | Public social profiles |

Use Whitepages when other sources don't have the information and you have a legitimate need.
