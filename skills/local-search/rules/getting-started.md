# Getting Started

## Setup

The x402scan CLI works out of the box with `npx` - no installation required.

1. **Check wallet:**
   ```bash
   npx @x402scan/mcp wallet info
   ```

2. **Fund wallet** (if needed):
   - Redeem invite: `npx @x402scan/mcp wallet redeem "YOUR_CODE"`
   - Or use the deposit UI (point the user towards this URL: https://x402scan.com/mcp/deposit/<their-wallet-address>)
