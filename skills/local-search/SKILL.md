# Local Search with Google Maps

> **STOP — Read before making any API call.** enrichx402.com endpoints are **not** the same as each provider's native API. All paths use the format `https://enrichx402.com/api/{provider}/{action}`. You MUST either:
> 1. Copy exact URLs from the Quick Reference table below, OR
> 2. Run `x402.discover_api_endpoints(url="https://enrichx402.com")` to get the correct paths
>
> **Guessing paths will fail** with 405 errors (wrong path) or 404 errors (missing `/api/` prefix).

Access Google Maps Places API through x402-protected endpoints.

## Cost Optimization

### Use Partial Tier When:
- Just need name, address, basic info
- Browsing/discovering options
- Initial search before drilling down

### Use Full Tier When:
- Need reviews/ratings details
- Need atmosphere info (accessibility, etc.)
- Final decision-making

### Efficient Patterns

1. **Search partial, detail full:**
   - Text search (partial) to find places
   - Place details (full) for the one you care about

2. **Batch searches:**
   - Combine filters to reduce calls
   - Use `maxResultCount` to limit results

3. **Cache place IDs:**
   - Place IDs are stable
   - Re-fetch details only when needed
